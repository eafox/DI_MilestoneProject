    "Both the US and the UK have recently seen large-scale protests in response to incidents of police brutality, particularly involving black citizens as the targets. After the first round of the London Met database was published, it was widely reported that a disproportionate amount of these use of force incidents involved black citizens. While only making up 13% of the city's population, [they were the subject of 36% of the incidents](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/aug/01/met-police-using-force-against-disproportionately-large-number-of-black-people).  \n",
    "The creation and release of these incident databases has actually been, in part, an attempt to determine whether these incidents are outliers or results of systematic bias. My analysis will be able to show which factors are the most important in the conscious and unconscious decision to use escalating levels of force. I will then be able to compare this observed decision making process between officers in the UK who do not commonly carry firearms and those in the US who do. "
